one of the things that i'm proud of and wanna show is when we programmed the robot and make it go in a square using intellji and the terminal.. and when i watched videos from lynda it was one of the amazing things to do and i enjoyed playing with lightbot a lot acutally. and i really love art and artists and i enjoy creating an art because its all about thinking and opening your mind and start thinking about ideas and its because i’m thinking of observing i’m open to ideas thinking about it combining different ideas together and thinking deeply about things and keeping and storing all those things in my imagination so i can draw from them later next is the phase where i start to conceptualize my idea and form it into something like a story or an image. 
What i do is build it inside my mind first before i put it on my paper and that helps me really work out the general idea of what i want. 
I Don't have to know all the absolute details i can develop those as i go along but you do have to be able to see it inside your head before you actually make it real sometimes it  might be helpful to decide whether i’m going to draw something from reference or whether i’m going to draw from my imagination or wether or not i’m going to do both and having a good idea that really helped me is kind of start to choose a direction for what am i going to paint i had a trouble on focusing on the details for something and it was in my imagination and from reference but i thought that it would be helpful to deconstruct it and break it down into its fundamental parts for example like what shape is it what color is it what's the texture whats the form of the object.and i really love victor vasely arts because of all these ilousional shapes and arts
